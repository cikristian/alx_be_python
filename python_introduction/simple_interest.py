# Define variables
principal = 1000       # Initial investment in dollars
rate = 0.05            # Annual interest rate as a decimal
time = 3               # Investment period in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
